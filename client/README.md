# Client

The Front End of my website was built using simple HTML, CSS and the React library.

## Pages
I've split the website into 3 pages and each page consists of multiple components and their seperate CSS files.
### Home
This is theh main page that will be seen, it consists of information about me, the programming languages that I know and the Projects that i've developed.
### Login
It is a simple page to access the edit page by obtaining a JWT
### Edit
This is where I edit my page to my liking and add new projects and make any changes
